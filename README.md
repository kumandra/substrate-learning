### Proof of Resources idea of ​​multi-mining

The current blockchain technology, the issued Token, is developed on the belief of a non-strong consensus compared to Bitcoin. The consensus of Bitcoin has been continuously strengthened. In the past ten years, new people have been attracted to reduce the circulation of Bitcoin, so that the price of Bitcoin can continue to be supported. If you want to create a new Token, you must follow this basic logic, which is to effectively reduce the circulation, so that the price of the currency will rise, so as to continuously strengthen the consensus and transform the weak consensus into a strong consensus. PORS is a very good direction and has the following advantages that cannot be ignored:

- Proof of Resources utilize PC Resources(CPU Core, Hard disk, Ram)
- Decentralized Virtual Machine
- To supporting smart contracts is a huge innovation.
